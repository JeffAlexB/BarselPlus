# BarselPlus â€“ Lean Canvas

## Problem
- Pregnancy journals in Norway are still paper-based.
- Paper records are prone to loss, damage, and are inconvenient to share.
- No lightweight prototype exists to demonstrate how this could be digitized.

## Customer Segments
- Healthcare providers (midwives, doctors).
- Patients and co-parents.
- For this vertical slice: **target audience is technical evaluators** (developers, managers, recruiters).

## Unique Value Proposition
- Demonstrates how pregnancy data can be stored and presented digitally.
- Shows a clean vertical slice implementation using modern full-stack technologies.
- Serves as a portfolio project showcasing technical and architectural skills.

## Solution
- Spring Boot + PostgreSQL backend with a clean database schema.
- Angular (or HTMX prototype) frontend for basic CRUD operations.
- Documentation covering scope, architecture, and testing approach.

## Channels
- GitHub repo (open source, public portfolio).
- Documentation and blog posts.

## Key Metrics
- Successful CRUD operations for patients and pregnancies.
- Passing integration tests for data persistence and validation.
- Clear, professional documentation.

## Unfair Advantage
- Unique perspective from combining healthcare background (nursing) with software development expertise.
- Demonstrates both technical execution and domain knowledge, as I'm a nurse with a wide background in healthcare.

## Cost Structure
- Developer time (self-funded project).
- Free/open-source tools and hosting (GitHub, local environment).

## Revenue Streams
- None. This is a portfolio/demonstration project.
