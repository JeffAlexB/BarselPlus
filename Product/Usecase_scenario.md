## Secondary Persona
**Lars – Developer (Project Owner)**  
- Building BarselPlus as a demo application.  
- Uses the system to demonstrate backend/frontend skills.

## Use Case Scenario (Prototype Scope)
1. Anna opens the BarselPlus prototype application (no login required).  
2. She searches for an existing patient record or creates a new one.  
3. She adds a pregnancy record linked to that patient.  
4. The system validates input (e.g., required fields, date formats).  
5. Anna views the pregnancy history for the patient in a simple read-only table.

*Note: In this demo prototype there is no authentication or role-based access control — the system is focused solely on core CRUD functionality.*
